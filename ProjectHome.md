# Introduction #
The BCCAPI (BitCoin Client API) allows you to create a light-weight secure Bitcoin client in Java for sending and receiving Bitcoins.
The BCCAPI connects to a server that holds the block chain, and which tracks the client’s wallet balance on the clients behalf. The server only has knowledge of the clients public keys, and is in no position to spend funds owned by the client’s wallet.
More information on the [What is the BCCAPI](WhatIsTheBCCAPI.md) wiki.

  * The Android app [BitcoinSpinner](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.miracleas.bitcoin_spinner) has been launched. It is built on top of the BCCAPI, and has received [impressive](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52674.0) feedback from the community.
  * The BCCAPI is currently being beta tested. You can help by:
    1. Giving feedback.
    1. Testing the SimpleClient which is built on top of the BCCAPI. (open source as well)
    1. Reviewing the code and validating that it is in fact not evil and trying to rip you off.
    1. Make a client for you favorite java enabled device. The BCCAPI makes this pretty straightforward.
  * Two BCCAPI servers are running at Rackspace, one for the Bitcoin test network and one for the Bitcoin production network.
